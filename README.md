# Travel List Project

Welcome to the Travel List project! This is a simple React application built with Vite that helps you manage your packing list for travel. The project consists of three main components:

- **App**: This component manages the state of the packing list items and renders other components like Logo, Form, PackingList, and Stats.

- **PackingList**: It renders the list of packing items, provides sorting options, and actions to delete items and clear the list.

- **Stats**: This component displays statistics about the packing list, including the total number of items, the number of packed items, and the packing progress percentage.
